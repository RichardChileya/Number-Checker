# Number Classification Program

This program allows the user to enter an integer and determines whether it is a deficient, perfect, or abundant number. 

## Getting Started

To run the program, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the source code files.
2. Open the terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the program files are located.
4. Run the program using a Python interpreter by executing the command: `python number_checker.py`
5. Enter an integer when prompted and press Enter.

## How it Works

The program uses a for loop to iterate through all numbers from 1 to (num - 1), where `num` is the user-entered integer. It checks if each number is a factor of `num` by using the modulus operator. If a number is a factor, it adds it to the `result` variable.


## Note

Please note that you need to rerun the program if you want to classify another number. Simply follow the steps mentioned in the "Getting Started" section.
